\lettersection{About Me}
I am a third year informatics student in the university of Edinburgh. For the best part of my undergraduate I have focused in artificial intelligence. I have gained extensive knowledge in Machine Learning, both analytically and applying it in practice, speech and natural language processing, and planning and intelligent agents. Moreover, I have learnt the standard concepts of computer science, such as algorithms and data structures, and software engineering. 

I am currently working on a robotics project with a team of students at my university. Our goal is to make a smart shelf with object retrieval. The user will indicate that they want an item from the shelf using a keypad, an app or Alexa. The System uses internal memory to position itself in the place where the item is, it scoops the item and places it on the a Turtlebot. The Turtlebot finds its way to the user and hands them the item using a robotic arm. The process can be repeated in reverse to put the item back in its place. In April we will be demonstrating in front of several companies, including Amazon.



\lettersection{Why Amazon Robotics?}

Ever since I was a kid I have been fascinated by robotics. I have owned a Raspberry Pi and an Arduino since I was 12 years old, and making simple robots has always been one of my favourite hobbies, such as a simple autonomous car and an motion-based light switch for my room.

Working as an intern for Amazon Robotics is the perfect opportunity to pursue this life-long passion and take the first step towards turning it into my profession. I believe that the resources at Amazon, together with the outstanding expertise of my potential colleagues and supervisors make this the perfect opportunity for me.

\lettersection{Why Me?}

I am convinced I am a good candidate for the position because of my skills in machine learning and artificial intelligence, and my experience working on a complex robotics project as part of a team. 

Furthermore, I believe that two of my strongest skills are the ability to learn independently and resilience. A good example are my results in the International Baccalaureate, one of the most challenging high-school programs, which I started after moving to Cambridge from Spain without speaking fluent English, and where I managed to obtain a grade that put me in the 99th percentile in the world.

In addition, I have good written and personal communication skills. I have been working as a code reviewer for Udacity for 5 years, where I have learnt how to provide feedback and constructive criticism on complex projects in a friendly and encouraging manner. Moreover, I have been a salsa teacher for several months, which has helped me develop good oral skills in front of a group and under pressure. 

The above reasons, together with my passion for robotics, would make me a good candidate for the position. I hope you take me into consideration.
